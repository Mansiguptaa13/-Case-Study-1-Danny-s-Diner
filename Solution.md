#### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
````sql
WITH dates_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    join_date, 
    join_date + 7 AS valid_date, 
    DATE_TRUNC( 'month', '2021-01-31'::DATE)  + interval '1 month'   - interval '1 day' AS last_date
  FROM dannys_diner.members
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 20 * menu.price
    WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date-1 AND dates.valid_date THEN 20 * menu.price
    ELSE 10 * menu.price END) AS points_earned
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON sales.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND sales.order_date <= dates.last_date
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
````
#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |

## Bonus Questions Solution
#### 1. The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.
````sql
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  s.order_date,
  mn.product_name,
  mn.price,
  CASE
    WHEN s.order_date >= mb.join_date THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N'
  END AS member
FROM
  dannys_diner.sales s
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu mn ON mn.product_id = s.product_id
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members mb ON mb.customer_id = s.customer_id
ORDER BY
  s.customer_id,
  s.order_date;
````

#### Answer:

| customer_id | order_date               | product_name | price | member |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ----- | ------ |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | sushi        | 10    | N      |

| C           | 2021-01-07 | ramen        | 12    | N      |

#### 2. Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
````sql
WITH
  classification_table AS (
    SELECT
      s.customer_id,
      s.order_date,
      mn.product_name,
      mn.price,
      mb.join_date,
      CASE
        WHEN s.order_date >= mb.join_date THEN 'Y'
        ELSE 'N'
      END AS member
    FROM
      dannys_diner.sales s
      LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu mn ON mn.product_id = s.product_id
      LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members mb ON mb.customer_id = s.customer_id
    ORDER BY
      s.customer_id,
      s.order_date
  )

  customer_id,
  order_date,
  product_name,
  price,

  CASE
    WHEN member = 'N' THEN null
    ELSE DENSE_RANK() OVER(
      PARTITION BY customer_id,
      member
      ORDER BY
        order_date
    )
  END AS ranking
FROM
